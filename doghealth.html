    <p class="text">The best way to diagnose any problem is with a visit to the vet.Treatment depends on what's causing a dog's distress, and may include fluid therapy, drugs to control vomiting, and homemade foods like well-cooked skinless chicken, boiled potatoes, and rice. Infectious diseases that affect dogs are important not only from a veterinary standpoint, but also because of the risk to public health; an example of this is rabies. Genetic disorders also affect dogs, often due to selective breeding to produce individual dog breeds. Due to the popularity of both commercial and homemade dog foods, nutrition is also a heavily studied subject.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="subpara">Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, as well as hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms. Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids, onion and garlic , grapes, macadamia nuts, xylitol and potentially ingested materials.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="subpara">Other diseases affecting dogs include endocrine diseases and reproductive diseases. Diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, and hypothyroidism are the most common endocrine diseases. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia is a devastating disease that causes severe anemia in dogs through destruction by the immune system. It has been seen with vaccinations and certain drugs, although many cases are idiopathic. A similar but less severe immune disease is immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, characterized by destruction of platelets. Common vaccines are parvovirus, coronavirus, rabies, a 5-way vaccine, a 7-way vaccine, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, bordatella and parainfluenza. There are some items you may want to consider before allowing your vet to give your dog non-core vaccinations. Things like your dogâ€™s age, size, breed, overall health and allergies are key factors.  </p> <br> <br><br><br>
