    <p class="text">The domestic dog a.k.a Canis lupus familiaris is a member of genus Canis. They are the most widely abundant carnivore. Dogs are called Man's best friend, referring to their millennia-long history of close relations, loyalty, and companionship with humans. Before the evolution of wolf into dog, it is posited that humans and wolves worked together hunting game.Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals and therapeutic roles.</p>

    <p class="subpara"> Rounded head, big and forward-facing eyes, loppy limbs and a teetering gait makes them the most loved pets. Characteristics like big eyes, chubby cheeks and giggling in infants are all designed to encourage others to look after them.  As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000â€“30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.</p>
  <!--
    <p class="subpara">Dog communication is about how dogs "speak" to each other, how they understand messages that humans send to them, and how humans can translate the ideas that dogs are trying to transmit. These communication behaviors include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture and gustatory communication. Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals and body posture. They are the most responsive animals.</p>
